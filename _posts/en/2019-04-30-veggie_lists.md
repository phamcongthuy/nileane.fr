NEW IMPORTANT DIET INFO FROM THE HOUSE RABBIT SOCIETY

According to the HRS, 75% of the fresh portion of diet should be leafy greens.  Leafy greens are now divided into two categories:  "Leafy Greens I" (High Oxalic Acid), and "Leafy Green II (low in Oxalic acid).  Also, no more than 15% should be non-leafy vegetables.  Please refer to HRS Veggie Recommendation for more information 

We have modified our list below to include HRS Classifications I & II, but please check HRS article by Dr. Susan Brown, for any updated diet recommendations. 

* * *

**VEGETABLES AND FRUITS USUALLY TOLERATED BY ADULT RABBITS**

**NOTES:**

1. Try to serve a mix of three or more vegetables each day.
2. Any food that is high in sugar, such as fruit, should be served as a treat only: one serving per day, no larger than your thumb.
3. Flowers from the local nursery probably have pesticides on them. Don’t serve them unless you know they’re organic.
4. Most rabbits can handle vegetables that are high in calcium or oxalates, as long as the vegetables are served in moderation, and the bunny doesn’t have kidney or urinary tract problems. If you have a healthy rabbit, do not hesitate to serve her wonderful vegetables such as kale, just because they are high in calcium.
5. Any food that causes diarrhea should be removed from the diet immediately!
